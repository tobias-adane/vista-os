# vista-os
Voice-first operating system for accessibility and intelligent assistance.

It’s powered by Iris, a cognitive and visual assistant that helps users interact with their devices entirely through voice and vision.

Vista replaces traditional icons and gestures with natural interaction — speak, tap, or hold to see, hear, and act.
